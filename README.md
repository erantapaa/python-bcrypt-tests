Overview
---

This project contains scripts to verify how the Perl module
`Crypt::Eksblowfish` works in order to derive a Python implementation.

- a pure Python implementation of EKS Blowfish (bcrypt2.py, eksblowfish2.py)
- testing scripts `cmp-expand-key`, `pl-expand-key`, `py-expand-key`

The Python code is taken from https://github.com/fwenzel/python-bcrypt

Testing
---

1. Make sure you have the CPAN module Crypt-Eksblowfish installed
2. Choose a salt (16 characters), a key (non-empty string) and a cost (int between 0 and 31)
and run ./cmp-expand-key _cost_ _salt_ _key_, e.g.:

    ./cmp-expand-key 8 1234567890123456 some-key

The script will dump the key schedule generated by the perl module to `out-pl`
and that of the python code to `out-py` and then diff them.
